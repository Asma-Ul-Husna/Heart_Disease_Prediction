        result is also compared to benchmark algorithms. Feature selection is one of the most important parts. over
        fitting,
        noisy data and extensive training times may all be avoided using feature selection. Researchers used the
        Relief
        feature
        selection approach. Data set has 14 attributes. Total 303 instances of which 164 instances belonged to the
        healthy and
        139 instances are heart disease patients. Data set sent into the feature selection step, which was used to
        identify the
        relevant features that cause heart disease. From the observations it has been identified that the proposed
        algorithm
        correctly classifies 61 instances. And neural networks are achieving 80.37percent accuracy.
